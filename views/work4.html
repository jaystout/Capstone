                    <h3 class="subheading">Justification of design decisions</h3>
                    <p>The current IKEA homepage is surprisingly extremely empty, and very white. It is simple to a fault, and seems to lack content and what they have displayed on their homepage is not what I would deem important to most users or interesting. It is not creative or colorful, so the first thing I did was add more of the iconic IKEA blue to the header and footer, increase the size of the logo to emphasize the brand, make the search bar more easy to see as before it was almost invisible, got rid of the “WELCOME TO IKEA US” that I found unprofessional looking, and added a picture of their store that filled more of the page width wise, so there wasn’t as much dead space on the sides of the page. There was a lot of unnecessary categories that could also be found on the navigation bar so I got rid of them and made the important categories larger, such as recent markdowns. By providing the blue color throughout the pages for example on buttons that emphasizes the choices the user has, makes them more interested in the content they are seeing, and by filling the page with more visual content and contrasting colors it has a certain flow and looks more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.</p>

                <h3 class="subheading">Why my decisions would increase value for a client</h3>
                <p>IKEA is known for being simple, clean, and affordable, which I reflected on their homepage by including markdowns in a larger category, adding more color and options and reducing the amount of dead space and filler categories that would cause them to click away, leading to more online sales and longer viewtimes. Previously on their current homepage you have to scroll down for a long time just to reach the bottom, and most users would just click out at that point. With mine it is to the point, and would not cause users to tire out.</p>

                <h3 class="subheading">Who my audience was, and how my design considers their needs</h3>
                <p>I primarilly identified my audience as younger adults to middle aged adults, those looking for affordable furniture that is contemporary and clean. I designed the webpage to reflect the way their products are displayed while still keeping the elements the users/customers would want to see promininent.</p>
